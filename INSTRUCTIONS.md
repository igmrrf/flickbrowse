# Build a Mini Movie Catalog App

## Description:
Build a small Flutter application called "FlickBrowse".

## Features & Requirements:

1. Movie List Screen:

- Display a list of movies fetched from a public API (e.g., The Movie Database API).

- Show the movie poster, title, and release year in a list/grid view.

- Implement basic pagination (Load more on scroll).

2. Movie Details Screen:

- On clicking a movie, navigate to a details screen.

- Show the movie’s title, description, genres, and rating.

- Add a "Favourite" button — when clicked, it should mark/unmark the movie as favourite.

3. Favourite Movies Screen:

- Accessible from the main screen.

- List all movies marked as favourite (Persisted locally using SQLite, Hive, or SharedPreferences).

- Search Functionality:
  - Add a search bar at the top of the Movie List Screen to search movies in real-time.

## Constraints & Expectations:

- Use Flutter + Dart.

- Good folder structure and clean code architecture are expected.

- Implement State Management (any one: Provider, Riverpod, Bloc, etc.) — Candidate should explain why they chose that.

- Show awareness of API error handling, loading states, and empty states.

- Using Flutter Hooks

- Applying Dependency Injection.

- Adding simple unit/widget tests

- Using Custom Animations or Transitions when moving between screens.

- Making the UI responsive.
