A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

Explain their project structure and why they structured it that way.

## Walk you through how they handled:

- API integration & error handling.

- State management decisions.

- Local persistence logic.

Discuss how they would scale the app if this was a production-ready app.

Reflect on things they would improve if they had more time.

Take feedback and showcase how they approach code reviews, suggestions, or challenges.
